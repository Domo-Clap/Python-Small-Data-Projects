# Python-Data-Analysis-Projects
Simple projects related to data analytics using Numpy, pandas, seaborn, and MPL.

I first learned about data analytics and programming back in my Junior year of college. I was a few months into my CS degree at SNHU, and I had to take a course on data analytics. At first, I felt it was a boring topic. But over time, I grew to really like the process of collecting data, transforming it, preparing it, and then gaining insights from it by analyzing said data. It is something I would definitely enjoy pursuing as a career, as I find it very enjoyable to write code that shows me more about something I am interested in.

This entire repository is just a small collection of some data analytic projects I have worked on using Python and Jupyter Notebook. With these projects, I was able to practice, and learn more about Pandas, Seaborn, and MPL. (Numpy is cool and all, but it can get boring and feels clunky). Most of the datasets involved with these projects I was able to gather from online sources. However, the parts where I analyzed the data was my own doing. I tried my best to experiment with both Seaborn and MPL for graphing the data, but I can definitely learn more about both libraries. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot from these projects. I was able to get hands on experience working with data in Python and using it to find out new things from mass amounts of data.

Some of the projects that are labeled practice are meant to be strictly for practice. They don't mean much in terms of what skills I possess with Python and data analytics. The others folders labeled project are work I have done on my own in order to improve my skills.

In the future, I plan on using the skills I have learned from here, to make an python app that lets users import csv or xlsx files, and perform basic analytics on said files.

Just added in a few new projects that focus on web scraping. Basically, all I did was use Selenium to access websites and scrape the data I wanted. From here, I could either push them to a db, or even use them directly in pandas. I may go back and do some analytics on the scraped data, but for now, I will leave them more as creating data collection systems. The Pokemon Web scraper also incorporates pandas and pyodbc to transform and move data to a local database.
